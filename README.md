# pymdp-cookbook
A collection of examples demonstrating active inference using [pymdp](https://github.com/infer-actively/pymdp)

These will largely focus on how to set up a generative model to represent real world problems

## Setup
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execution
You can run any of the examples independently with e.g. `python3 perception.py`
